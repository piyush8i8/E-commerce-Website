This repository hosts a full-stack eCommerce website developed using the MERN stack, which integrates MongoDB for the database, Express.js as the backend framework, React for the frontend, and Node.js as the runtime environment. The project is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users while offering robust management capabilities for administrators.

Key features include user authentication, product browsing, shopping cart functionality, and secure payment processing. On the backend, MongoDB stores product data, user information, and order details, while Express.js and Node.js handle API requests, user authentication, and server-side logic. The frontend, powered by React, offers a dynamic and responsive user interface, ensuring a smooth and engaging shopping experience across devices.

A significant highlight of this project is the admin dashboard, which allows administrators to efficiently manage all aspects of the eCommerce platform. This includes adding, editing, or removing products, tracking and processing orders, managing users, and monitoring site performance. The dashboard is designed with a user-friendly interface, enabling easy navigation and control over the platform's operations. Overall, this project demonstrates a complete and scalable solution for online retail using modern web technologies.
